I am currently a Research Assistant in Urban Mobilities within the Transport Studies Department, School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford. I am interested in climate science, sustainable transport, data analysis, gender and health. My current work includes mapping the air pollution exposure across mobility scenarios of low-income women in Colombia, and modelling speeding behaviour on 20mph roads in London. I hold a BA (Hons) in Geography from the University of Cambridge, and an MSc in Marine Science from the University of Exeter. On my website you can find my recent work and publications, and my contact information - I am always happy to connect with people in similar fields and discuss research.
